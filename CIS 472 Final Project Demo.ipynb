    "## Introduction\n",
    "This is a demo of the image classification algorithms implemented for our final project in CIS 472 Machine Learning at the University of Oregon.\n",
    "The algorithms are convolutional neural nets being applied to images from the SIIM-ISIC Melanoma Classification Challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific files consist of around 33 thousand `jpg` files that have been cropped in to 256x256 max squares.\n",
    "Because the provided 'test' set does not include correct labels (as that would defeat the purpose of the contest),\n",
    "in order to evaluate our performance, we take pseudo-random subsets from the 'train' set to use as our actual training and testing sets.\n",
    "(The subsets can be regenerated by changing the numpy seed when calling `load_images`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two algorithms have been implemented: AlexNet and ~~EfficientNet~~.\n"
